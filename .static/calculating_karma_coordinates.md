## Overview
This paper explains the logic behind Karma coordinate calculations. Every attempt is made to provide references to the scientific and/or philosophical and/or theological doctrines that contributed to the concept of Karma Coordinates. It is only upon the contemplation and meditation on these doctrines that the concept of Karma Coordinates has manifested itself. 

People in different phases and states/conditions of their lives may have varied opinions on these doctrines from completely in agreement to completely in denial. Such varied opinion however shall not keep anyone from benefitting from Karma Coordinates. The first and foremost benefit is that it will set you on a *path of success*. The second benefit is the effective development of *thought process* that is a must in today's complex and challenging world to overcome difficult times, which happen to everyone of us and are beyond our control. The third benefit is to *learn about various activities* that will help you grow.

## Clarity of thinking
The fundamental aspect of Karma Coordinates is to *measure, assess and help grow the clarity of thinking* that one requires in deciphering what is true and real and what is not. With clarity of thoughts one arrives at right decisions. 

When one remembers a thing, what is actually happening? We know, the brain *physically gets modified* to retain the information. Everything we see, hear, smell, taste and touch - our five sensory faculties are constantly collecting information, sending it to brain, which too is constantly getting physically modified. The physical modifications of brain can be categorized in four types 1) false information 2) inaccurate information  3) complacency and 4) true knowledge. 

- False information: Visualize a scenario, you walk into a dark room and there is a rope on the floor. You think it is a snake. You get scared and run out of the room. What has happened here? Well, actually your brain got physically modified and now has retained a piece of information that there is a snake in the room. Imagine hundreds of such *false information* registering in a brain. Will decisions based on such information yield right outcome?  
- Inaccurate information: Many people are born with or develop faulty sensory faculties. For example, in the evening you see a person standing 500 feet away when there is actually a tree, etc. Imagine hundreds of such *inaccuarate information* registering in a brain. Decisions are not going to be based on reality and truth. 
- Complacency: Complacency is a state where not much modifications are happening. You go to office, nothing new happens. You sit in front of TV, nothing new is seen. No new information is being registered. Such stagnation is not conducive to achieving clarity of thinking.
- True knowledge: True knowledge is a state where the above three are missing. It is a state of physical modification where a brain holds only the true and real information. Visualize this state, all decisions in this state will be right. One will have complete clarity of things observed by the five sensory faculties.

*Sankhya* has described these states in this karika:
एष प्रत्ययसर्गो विपर्ययाशक्तितुष्टिसिद्ध्याख्यः । गुणवैषम्यविमर्द्देन तस्य भेदास्तु पञ्चाशत् ॥ ४६ ॥
This is the creation of Buddhi, termed ignorance, incapacity, complacency, and perfection. And from the conflict of the Gunas in unequal degree of strength, its sorts, again, are fifty.

Further it quantifies the factors associated with the clarity of thinking in this karika:
पञ्च विपर्ययभेदा भवन्त्यशक्तिश्च करणवैकल्यात् । अष्टाविंशतिभेदा तुष्टिर्नवधाऽष्टधा सिद्धिः ॥ ४७ ॥
Five are the divisions of ignorance; and according to the impairment of the instruments, incapacity has twenty-eight varieties; while complacency is ninefold; perfection, eightfold.

## Calculating the clarity of thinking score
The clarity of one's thinking is thus the fundamental aspect of Karma Coordinates computation. *Sankhya* describes fifty positive and negative factors contributing to the clarity in these karikas:  

### Ignorance
भेदस्तमसोऽष्टविधो मोहस्य च, दशविधो महामोहः । तामिस्रोऽष्टादशधा, तथा भवत्यन्धतामिस्रः ॥ ४८ ॥
The distinctions of Avidya are eightfold, as also of Asmita; tenfold is Raga; Dvesa is eighteenfold; so also is Abhinivesa.

Karma Coordinates currently uses these factors below in computing the Ingorance/*Viparyayah* score:
Misunderstanding of reality and the nature of existence, a false sense of identity or self, attachment to pleasurable experiences, aversion to certain situations or experiences that are perceived as painful, and a deep-seated fear of death and an unexamined attachment to life itself.


### Inability or Incapacity
एकादशेन्द्रियवधाः सह बुद्धिवधैरशक्तिरुद्दिष्टा । सप्तदश वधा बुद्धेर्विपर्ययात् तुष्टिसिद्धीनाम् ॥ ४९ ॥
Injuries of the eleven Indriyas, together with injuries of Buddhi, are pronounced to be Incapacity. The injuries of Buddhi are seventeen, through inversion of complacencies and perfections.

Karma Coordinates currently uses these factors below in computing the Incapacity/*Ashakti* score:
Lack of Knowledge, Confusion Regarding Identity, Attachment to Objects, Inability to Manage Suffering, Impairment of Perception, Cognitive Delays, Misinterpretation, Sensory Overload, Dissociation, Physical Impairment, Emotional Instability, Intellectual Limitations, Social Anxiety, Repetitive Habits, Conflicting Intentions, Distraction, Resistance to Change, Lack of Motivation, Social Withdrawal, Unrealistic Expectations, Negative Self-Comparison, Dependence on Others, Communication Barriers, Indulgence, Analysis Paralysis, Poor Self-Image, Emotional Dysregulation, and Inability to Embrace Change.

### Complecency
आध्यात्मिकाश्चतस्रः प्रकृत्युपादानकालभाग्याख्याः । बाह्या विषयोपरमात् पञ्च, नव तुष्टयोऽभिहिताः ॥ ५० ॥
The nine Complacencies are propounded : the four Self-regarding ones called after Prakriti, Material, Time, and Luck ; the external five, through abstinence from objects.

Karma Coordinates currently uses these factors below in computing the Complecency/*Tushti* score:
Satisfaction achieved through detachment and abstaining from sensory pleasures, a sense of satisfaction from making extensive sacrifices or offerings, Satisfaction from achieving a state of equilibrium and balance in life, Satisfaction from selflessly serving others or contributing to their well-being, and Satisfaction found in social cooperation, harmony, and communal living.

### True and Real Knowledge
ऊहः शब्दोऽध्ययनं दुःखविघातास्त्रयः सुहृत्प्राप्तिः । दानं च सिद्धयोऽष्टौ सिद्धेः पूर्वोऽङ्कुशस्त्रिविधः ॥ ५१ ॥
Argumentation, Word, Study, the three Preventions of Pain, Acquisition of friends, Charity or Purity are the eight Perfections. Those mentioned before Perfec tion are the threefold goad to (Ignorance and suffering).

Karma Coordinates currently uses these factors below in computing the Knowledge/*Siddhi* score:
Ability to reason, Mastery of vocabulary, Ability to do dedicated studies/efforts, Knowledge of technology to overcome sorrows, Knowledge of technolgoy/medical sciences/psychology/philosophy to overcome physical pain/disease and mental pain, Acquisition of good people, and Giving time, money for benefit of all

Positive factors help develop clarity and negative factors make thinking foggy.

### Formula
We scale the above factors and calculate the clarity of thinking score as: *Siddhi (-2:2)* + *Viparyayah (-4:0)* + *Ashakti (-4:0)* + *Tushti (-4:0) + *Lifestyle (-1:1)* 

## Calculating number of lives 
The calculated clarity of thinking score is scaled to -1 to 1. It is then transposed into *number of lives* based on 1) duration of universe, and 2) a concept that every *Sukshm* transmigrate through every species - and average duration of each life/existence.

### Duration of *Prakriti*
Duration of *Prakriti*, i.e. the age of the universe is an evolving number. Varying from about 7 billion years old to 13.8 billion years old. For Karma Coordiates calculation currently we have used The Friedmann Equation model. As per the open model with omega of 5, universe is about 13.8 billion years old and it will end when it is about 27.6 billion years old - that is in another 13.8 billion years (Wikipedia contributors. (2024, June 27); *Ultimate fate of the universe*).

In physical cosmology, the age of the universe is the time elapsed since the Big Bang. Astronomers have derived two different measurements of the age of the universe: a measurement based on direct observations of an early state of the universe, which indicate an age of 13.787±0.020 billion years as interpreted with the Lambda-CDM concordance model as of 2021; and a measurement based on the observations of the local, modern universe, which suggest a younger age. (Wikipedia contributors. (2024, July 22). *Age of the universe*.)

सहस्रयुगपर्यन्तमहर्यद्ब्रह्मणो विदु: | रात्रिं युगसहस्रान्तां तेऽहोरात्रविदो जना: || 17|| (Bhagavad Gita, ch. 8 verse.17).
One day of Brahma (kalp) lasts a thousand cycles of the four ages (mahā yug) and his night also extends for the same span of time. The wise who know this understand the reality about day and night (Bhagavad Gita, ch. 8 verse.17)..


### *Sukshm* transmigrating through every species
*Sukshm* is the finest microscoping particle in *Prakriti* that brings *Jiv* into existence. *Sukshm* is premordial, independent, continuous, a finest particle in the universe. It goes from existence to existence - and gets tinged with *Bhav* (tendencies) during an existence. (Aniruddha. et al., 1915, p. 33, Shloka 39-40)

जातस्य हि ध्रुवो मृत्युर्ध्रुवं जन्म मृतस्य च | तस्मादपरिहार्येऽर्थे न त्वं शोचितुमर्हसि || 27|| (Bhagavad Gita, ch. 2 verse. 27).
Death is certain for one who has been born, and rebirth is inevitable for one who has died. Therefore, you should not lament over the inevitable (Bhagavad Gita, ch. 2 verse. 27).

आब्रह्मभुवनाल्लोका: पुनरावर्तिनोऽर्जुन | मामुपेत्य तु कौन्तेय पुनर्जन्म न विद्यते || 16|| (Bhagavad Gita, ch. 8 verse.16)
In all the worlds of this material creation, up to the highest abode of Brahma, you will be subject to rebirth, O Arjun. But on attaining My Abode, O son of Kunti, there is no further rebirth (Bhagavad Gita, ch. 8 verse.16).

They will pass through 8.4 millions species; this number does not decrease or rise (DiscoverSikhism, p. 4537, 1.936-3).

The 8.4 millions species of beings die, and die again, and are born over and over again. They are consigned to reincarnation (DiscoverSikhism, p. 4836, 5.998-19).

Wandering and roaming through 8.4 million incarnations, you have now been given this human life, so difficult to obtain (DiscoverSikhism, p. 4922, 5.1017-2).

His beings wander insanely through 8.4 million incarnations (DiscoverSikhism, p. 5650, 5.1161-7)

देहिनोऽस्मिन्यथा देहे कौमारं यौवनं जरा । तथा देहान्तरप्राप्तिर्धीरस्तत्र न मुह्यति ॥ १३ ॥ (Bhagavad Gita, ch. 2 verse. 13).
Just as the embodied soul continuously passes from childhood to youth to old age, similarly, at the time of death, the soul passes into another body. The wise are not deluded by this. (Bhagavad Gita, ch. 2 verse. 13).

वासांसि जीर्णानि यथा विहाय नवानि गृह्णाति नरोऽपराणि | तथा शरीराणि विहाय जीर्णा न्यन्यानि संयाति नवानि देही || 22|| (Bhagavad Gita, ch. 2 verse. 22).
As a person sheds worn-out garments and wears new ones, likewise, at the time of death, the soul casts off its worn-out body and enters a new one (Bhagavad Gita, ch. 2 verse. 22)..


#### Number of species:
Knowing the number of species on Earth is one of the most basic yet elusive questions in science. Unfortunately, obtaining an accurate number is constrained by the fact that most species remain to be described and because indirect attempts to answer this question have been highly controversial. Here, we document that the taxonomic classification of species into higher taxonomic groups (from genera to phyla) follows a consistent pattern from which the total number of species in any taxonomic group can be predicted. Assessment of this pattern for all kingdoms of life on Earth predicts ∼8.7 million (±1.3 million SE) species globally, of which ∼2.2 million (±0.18 million SE) are marine. Our results suggest that some 86% of the species on Earth, and 91% in the ocean, still await description (Mora C et al., 2011).


॥ श्रीविष्णुरुवाच ॥ ॥ पुत्र त्वं विधिना चाद्य कुरु ब्रह्मांडगोलके ॥ पातालं भूतलं चैव सिंधुसागरकाननम्‌ ॥ २६ ॥ वृक्षाश्च गिरयो द्विपदाः पशवस्तथा ॥ पक्षिणश्रैव गंधर्वाः सिद्वा यक्षाश्च राक्षसाः ॥ २७॥ श्रापदाद्याश्च ये जीवाश्चतुराशीतियोनयः ॥ उद्भिजाः स्वेदजाश्चैव जरायुजास्तथांडजाः ॥२८॥ **एकविंशतिलक्षाणि एकैकस्य च योनयः** ॥ कुरु त्वं सकलं चाशु इत्युक्त्वांतरधीयत ॥ ब्रह्मणा निर्मितं सर्वं ब्रह्मांडं च यथोदितम्‌ ॥ २९ ॥ (Shri Skand Purana 3, Brahma Khanda 2, Dharmaranya Khanda 8.26-8.29)

Śrīviṣṇu said (to Brahma): "Now, dear son, create duly nether worlds, earth, rivers, seas and forests in the Cosmic Sphere. The following too should be created: trees, mountains, bipeds, animals, birds, Gandharvas, Siddhas, Yakṣas, Rākṣasas, beasts of prey and all those living beings. They are to be of four different types, each consisting of two million and one hundred thousand species (**eight million and four hundred thousand species**). They are: (1) Udbhijjas or species of vegetation that grow breaking up the surface of the earth; (2) Svedajas or sweat-born ones such as insects, worms etc.; (3) Jarāyujas (viviparous beings) and (4) Aṇḍajas (oviparous beings). You create all these things quickly.” After saying this, he vanished. The Cosmic Egg was created by Brahmā in the manner as instructed (Shri Skand Purana 3, Brahma Khanda 2, Dharmaranya Khanda 8.26-8.29).

अथान्यचाप्युक्तं यः कर्त्ता सोऽयं वै भूतात्मा करणैःकारयिताऽन्तःपुरुषः। अथ यथाग्निनाऽयः पिण्डो वाऽभिभूतः कर्तृभिर्हन्यमानो नानात्वमुपैत्येवं वाव खल्वसौ भूतात्माऽन्तःपुरुषेणाभिभूतो गुणैर्हन्यमानो नानात्वमुपैत्यथ यत्त्रिगुणं | **चतुरशीतिलक्षयोनि** परिणतं भूतत्रिगुणमेतद्वै नानात्वस्य रूपं | तानि ह वा एतानि गुणानि पुरुषेणेरितानि चक्रमिव चक्रिणेति | अथ यथाऽयः पिण्डे हन्यमाने नाग्निरभिभूयत्येवं नाभिभूयत्यसौ पुरुषोऽभिभूयत्ययं भूतात्मोपसं श्लिष्टत्वात् इति ॥ ३ ॥ (Sanskrit Commentary of Upanishad Brahmayogin, 2016, p. 437)

अथान्यचाप्युक्तं यः कर्त्ता सोऽयं वै भूतात्मा करणैःकारयितान्तःपुरुषः। अथ यथाग्निनाऽयस्पिण्डो वाभिभूतः कर्तृभिर्हन्यमानो नानात्वमुपैत्येवं वाव खल्वसौ भूतात्मान्तःपुरुषेणाभिभूतो गुणैर्हन्यमानो नानात्वमुपैति | **चतुर्जालं चतुर्दशविधं चतुरशीतिधा** परिणतं भूतगणमेतद्दै नानात्वस्य रूपं | तानि इ वा एतानि गुणानि पुरुषेणेरितानि चक्रमिव मृत्पचेनेति | अथ यथाऽयस्पिण्डे हन्यमाने नाग्निरांभभूयत्यावं नाभिभूयत्यसौ पुरुषोऽभिभूयत्ययं भूतात्मोपसंश्लिष्टत्वादिति ॥ ३ ॥ (Ed by K B Cowell With Commentary By Rama Tirtha, 1935, p. 48)

Through 8.4 million incarnations they wander lost and confused; through all their wandering and roaming, they are ruined (DiscoverSikhism, p. 129, 3.27-4).


#### *Moksha*
कर्मजं बुद्धियुक्ता हि फलं त्यक्त्वा मनीषिण: | जन्मबन्धविनिर्मुक्ता: पदं गच्छन्त्यनामयम् || 51|| (Bhagavad Gita, ch. 2 verse.51).

The wise ones, whose mind is immersed in wisdom and intelligence, detach themselves from the fruit of born of their actions. On doing so they free themselves from the bondage of re-birth and thus go on to attain a state of being which is beyond all sufferings (Bhagavad Gita, ch. 2 verse.51)..


## Scientific Inquiry
Everyday we witness millions of *Jiv* being born around us in form of various species and millions dying. Every *Jiv* has a unique experience. A *Jiv* comes into an existence, encounters unique experiences, develops *Bhav* and then perishes. What is the precursors to *Jiv*? Why every *Jiv* is presented a unique experience? If *Jiv* perishes, what continues - Who is the witness that knows after perishing of *Jiv*?? Is it an awareness, *Sukshm*, or God? In this *Prakriti* made up of three *Gunas*, what material is awareness, *Sukshm* or God made up of? 

*Sankhya* means numeric/quantifiable and has laid down a foundation for logical articulation of the construct of our universe. KarmaCoordinates builds upon this foundation and proposes a framework to calculate number of lives till *Moksha*.
