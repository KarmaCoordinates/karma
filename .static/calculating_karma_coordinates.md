# Title: Calculating Karma Coodinates; Author: Sandeep Dixit; Date: July 24, 2004; Edition: 1.0

## Overview
This paper explains the formula used to calculate Karma Coordinates. Every attempt is made to provide references to the philosophical and/or theological doctrines that contributed to the concept of Karma Coordinates. It is only upon contemplation and meditation on these doctrines has the concept of Karma Coordinates manifested itself. 

People in different phases and/or states of their lives may have varied opinions on some of these doctrines from completely in agreement to completely in denial. Such varied opinion shall not keep anyone from benefitting from Karma Coordinates. The first and foremost benefit is that it will set you on a path of success. The fundamental aspect of Karma Coordinates is to measure/assess and help grow the clarity one requires in deciphering what is true and what is not. With clarity of thoughts one can achieve miracles! Second benefit is to develop some philosophical thought process that is needed to overcome difficult times that happen to everyone of us with us unable to do anything about it. And third benefit is to help you be the master of your own destiny.



## Factors used in calculating Karma Corodinates
### Positive factors
- Knowledge: This is measured in terms of years of education and/or equivalent experience.
- Discipline: Certain disciplines develop natural inclination to rationalization and proensity to achieving clarity.
- Diet: Our diet supports our activities. One of the activity to achieve clarity is the way we think. Excessively lithargic diet will not help in growing the clarity. Whereas diet that is stimulating will help in growing the clarity.
- Workout: Regular workout is essential to keep us healthy and create vital forces. In poor health most likely time will be spent on taking care of the physical needs. There won't be any time left for dedicated effort in achieving clarity of thoughts.
- Spirituality: Sprituality or thinking about questions such as what is the purpose of this universe, why are life forms created, what is our purpose, is an essential activity to trigger the process of achieving clarity. 
- Fasting: Fasting is a tools for developing control over one's impulses. It is a tool to achieve good health as well.
### Negative factors
- Drink: Drinking/smoking, etc muddy one's thinking. And works against the process of clarity development.
- Positive or negative emotions: Both positive and negative emotions take over / dominates one's thinking and thus deviating one from the path of achieving clarity.
- Use of swear words: Use of swear words typically is a state where one lacks the vocabulary to articulate the state of mind. Right vocabulary is a must tool so when one thinks there is also a right formulation of reasoning.


# What is the basis of transmigrating through many existences?
- Number of species, every *Jiva* *Sukshma* has to transmigrate,  

# Who achieves Moksha
कर्मजं बुद्धियुक्ता हि फलं त्यक्त्वा मनीषिण: | जन्मबन्धविनिर्मुक्ता: पदं गच्छन्त्यनामयम् || 51|| (Bhagavad Gita, ch. 2 verse.51).

The wise ones, whose mind is immersed in wisdom and intelligence, detach themselves from the fruit of born of their actions. On doing so they free themselves from the bondage of re-birth and thus go on to attain a state of being which is beyond all sufferings (Bhagavad Gita, ch. 2 verse.51)..

## Duration of universe

सहस्रयुगपर्यन्तमहर्यद्ब्रह्मणो विदु: | रात्रिं युगसहस्रान्तां तेऽहोरात्रविदो जना: || 17|| (Bhagavad Gita, ch. 8 verse.17).
One day of Brahma (kalp) lasts a thousand cycles of the four ages (mahā yug) and his night also extends for the same span of time. The wise who know this understand the reality about day and night (Bhagavad Gita, ch. 8 verse.17)..

## Number of species:
Knowing the number of species on Earth is one of the most basic yet elusive questions in science. Unfortunately, obtaining an accurate number is constrained by the fact that most species remain to be described and because indirect attempts to answer this question have been highly controversial. Here, we document that the taxonomic classification of species into higher taxonomic groups (from genera to phyla) follows a consistent pattern from which the total number of species in any taxonomic group can be predicted. Assessment of this pattern for all kingdoms of life on Earth predicts ∼8.7 million (±1.3 million SE) species globally, of which ∼2.2 million (±0.18 million SE) are marine. Our results suggest that some 86% of the species on Earth, and 91% in the ocean, still await description (Mora C et al., 2011).


॥ श्रीविष्णुरुवाच ॥ ॥ पुत्र त्वं विधिना चाद्य कुरु ब्रह्मांडगोलके ॥ पातालं भूतलं चैव सिंधुसागरकाननम्‌ ॥ २६ ॥ वृक्षाश्च गिरयो द्विपदाः पशवस्तथा ॥ पक्षिणश्रैव गंधर्वाः सिद्वा यक्षाश्च राक्षसाः ॥ २७॥ श्रापदाद्याश्च ये जीवाश्चतुराशीतियोनयः ॥ उद्भिजाः स्वेदजाश्चैव जरायुजास्तथांडजाः ॥२८॥ **एकविंशतिलक्षाणि एकैकस्य च योनयः** ॥ कुरु त्वं सकलं चाशु इत्युक्त्वांतरधीयत ॥ ब्रह्मणा निर्मितं सर्वं ब्रह्मांडं च यथोदितम्‌ ॥ २९ ॥ (Shri Skand Purana 3, Brahma Khanda 2, Dharmaranya Khanda 8.26-8.29)

Śrīviṣṇu said (to Brahma): "Now, dear son, create duly nether worlds, earth, rivers, seas and forests in the Cosmic Sphere. The following too should be created: trees, mountains, bipeds, animals, birds, Gandharvas, Siddhas, Yakṣas, Rākṣasas, beasts of prey and all those living beings. They are to be of four different types, each consisting of two million and one hundred thousand species (**eight million and four hundred thousand species**). They are: (1) Udbhijjas or species of vegetation that grow breaking up the surface of the earth; (2) Svedajas or sweat-born ones such as insects, worms etc.; (3) Jarāyujas (viviparous beings) and (4) Aṇḍajas (oviparous beings). You create all these things quickly.” After saying this, he vanished. The Cosmic Egg was created by Brahmā in the manner as instructed (Shri Skand Purana 3, Brahma Khanda 2, Dharmaranya Khanda 8.26-8.29).

अथान्यचाप्युक्तं यः कर्त्ता सोऽयं वै भूतात्मा करणैःकारयिताऽन्तःपुरुषः। अथ यथाग्निनाऽयः पिण्डो वाऽभिभूतः कर्तृभिर्हन्यमानो नानात्वमुपैत्येवं वाव खल्वसौ भूतात्माऽन्तःपुरुषेणाभिभूतो गुणैर्हन्यमानो नानात्वमुपैत्यथ यत्त्रिगुणं | **चतुरशीतिलक्षयोनि** परिणतं भूतत्रिगुणमेतद्वै नानात्वस्य रूपं | तानि ह वा एतानि गुणानि पुरुषेणेरितानि चक्रमिव चक्रिणेति | अथ यथाऽयः पिण्डे हन्यमाने नाग्निरभिभूयत्येवं नाभिभूयत्यसौ पुरुषोऽभिभूयत्ययं भूतात्मोपसं श्लिष्टत्वात् इति ॥ ३ ॥ (Sanskrit Commentary of Upanishad Brahmayogin, 2016, p. 437)

अथान्यचाप्युक्तं यः कर्त्ता सोऽयं वै भूतात्मा करणैःकारयितान्तःपुरुषः। अथ यथाग्निनाऽयस्पिण्डो वाभिभूतः कर्तृभिर्हन्यमानो नानात्वमुपैत्येवं वाव खल्वसौ भूतात्मान्तःपुरुषेणाभिभूतो गुणैर्हन्यमानो नानात्वमुपैति | **चतुर्जालं चतुर्दशविधं चतुरशीतिधा** परिणतं भूतगणमेतद्दै नानात्वस्य रूपं | तानि इ वा एतानि गुणानि पुरुषेणेरितानि चक्रमिव मृत्पचेनेति | अथ यथाऽयस्पिण्डे हन्यमाने नाग्निरांभभूयत्यावं नाभिभूयत्यसौ पुरुषोऽभिभूयत्ययं भूतात्मोपसंश्लिष्टत्वादिति ॥ ३ ॥ (Ed by K B Cowell With Commentary By Rama Tirtha, 1935, p. 48)

Through 8.4 million incarnations they wander lost and confused; through all their wandering and roaming, they are ruined (DiscoverSikhism, p. 129, 3.27-4).


## Rebirth through every species

जातस्य हि ध्रुवो मृत्युर्ध्रुवं जन्म मृतस्य च | तस्मादपरिहार्येऽर्थे न त्वं शोचितुमर्हसि || 27|| (Bhagavad Gita, ch. 2 verse. 27).
Death is certain for one who has been born, and rebirth is inevitable for one who has died. Therefore, you should not lament over the inevitable (Bhagavad Gita, ch. 2 verse. 27).

आब्रह्मभुवनाल्लोका: पुनरावर्तिनोऽर्जुन | मामुपेत्य तु कौन्तेय पुनर्जन्म न विद्यते || 16|| (Bhagavad Gita, ch. 8 verse.16)
In all the worlds of this material creation, up to the highest abode of Brahma, you will be subject to rebirth, O Arjun. But on attaining My Abode, O son of Kunti, there is no further rebirth (Bhagavad Gita, ch. 8 verse.16).

They will pass through 8.4 millions species; this number does not decrease or rise (DiscoverSikhism, p. 4537, 1.936-3).

The 8.4 millions species of beings die, and die again, and are born over and over again. They are consigned to reincarnation (DiscoverSikhism, p. 4836, 5.998-19).

Wandering and roaming through 8.4 million incarnations, you have now been given this human life, so difficult to obtain (DiscoverSikhism, p. 4922, 5.1017-2).

His beings wander insanely through 8.4 million incarnations (DiscoverSikhism, p. 5650, 5.1161-7)


देहिनोऽस्मिन्यथा देहे कौमारं यौवनं जरा । तथा देहान्तरप्राप्तिर्धीरस्तत्र न मुह्यति ॥ १३ ॥ (Bhagavad Gita, ch. 2 verse. 13).
Just as the embodied soul continuously passes from childhood to youth to old age, similarly, at the time of death, the soul passes into another body. The wise are not deluded by this. (Bhagavad Gita, ch. 2 verse. 13).

वासांसि जीर्णानि यथा विहाय नवानि गृह्णाति नरोऽपराणि | तथा शरीराणि विहाय जीर्णा न्यन्यानि संयाति नवानि देही || 22|| (Bhagavad Gita, ch. 2 verse. 22).
As a person sheds worn-out garments and wears new ones, likewise, at the time of death, the soul casts off its worn-out body and enters a new one (Bhagavad Gita, ch. 2 verse. 22)..

## Deduction
### If I exist now, isn't it a proof enough that I will exist again? What is stopping me from existing again? "I" is an awareness.
