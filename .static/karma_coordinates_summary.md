According to *Sankhya*, a doctrine acredited to Kapil *Muni* (Sage) dating back to 5561 BCE, *Prakriti* (the universe) exists for providing experiences to *Purush* (an experiencer) (Aniruddha. et al., 1915, p. 20, Shloka 21). *Purush* upon realization that “I exist” achieves *Moksh* (liberation) (Aniruddha. et al., 1915, p. 48-49, Shloka 64-66). *Prakriti* is constructed of three *Guna* (properties of root element) - *Sattv* (light), *Rajas* (energy) and *Tamas* (mass)  and *Purush* is an unobservable entity outside of *Prakriti* that is not constructed of these three *Gunas* (Aniruddha. et al., 1915, p. 17, Shloka 17).

Every *Jiv* (life-form) in *Prakriti* is engaged in providing experiences to a *Purush* that incite *Bhav* (tendencies). *Jiv* comes into an existence due to *Sukshm* (a microscopic particle). It is *Sukshm* that gets tinged with *Bhav*, carrying *Bhav* from existence to existence! Once all *Bhav* are overcome/consumed, *Purush* realizes "I exist"/becomes aware of itself and *Moksh* is achieved. A human life is the only known form of *Sukshm* that is capable of achieving *Moksh* for its *Purush*. (Aniruddha. et al., 1915, p. 33, Shloka 39-40)

Once all *Purush* awake, *Prakriti*’s work is complete and it collapses into a singularity and the next cycle of big-bang - big-crunch begins. As per the open model with omega of 5, universe is about 13.8 billion years old and it will end when it is about 27.6 billion years old - that is in another 13.8 billion years (Wikipedia contributors. (2024, June 27); Ultimate fate of the universe).  

*Sankhya*-yoga quantifies *Bhav*, overcoming which takes a *Sukshm* closer to achieving *Moksh* (Aniruddha. et al., 1915, p. 38-41, Shloka 46-51). Karma Coordinates is a fun app developed to calculate your current position in this karmic journey of many lives - from the beginning to *Moksh* - by approximating your current *Bhav* (Sandeep Dixit, 2024). It is important to know that even small lifestyle changes can put you on a superfast-track - speeding your journey by thousands of years!
