<h3>How does it work?</h3>
  <p> Karma Coordinates interprets your journal entries, uses that interpretation to answer relevant questions from the

<h3>How is the assessment questionnaire prepared?</h3>
  <p>
    {{kapil_muni}}
    The assessment questionnaire is based on <em>Sankhya</em> — a doctrine by Sage Kapil <em>Muni</em>, dating back to 5561 BCE—which
    articulates that the purpose of the universe is to provide experiences to every life-form. Each experience results
    in a physical modification of the brain or intellect (<em>Buddhi</em>), commonly referred to as memory. These modifications
    are classified into four categories: Ignorance (<em>Viparyay</em>), Incapacity (<em>Ashakti</em>), Complacency (<em>Tushti</em>), or True Knowledge (<em>Siddhi</em>). 
    Sankhya further defines 5, 28, 9, and 8 subcategories for these categories respectively. The clarity of thinking questionnaire 
    contains 50 questions to determine the current state of these 50 subcategories. In addition Lifestyle is added as a bonus category 
    to take into account the modern ways of life. 
    Attaining the state of <em>Siddhi</em> allows one to experience the ultimate truth. At that point, the purpose of the
    universe is fulfilled—resulting in <em>Moksha</em>, the end of the life-form’s journey through many lives and experiences
    (Aniruddha et al., 1915 <a href="https://archive.org/details/thesamkhyaphilos00sinhuoft/page/48/mode/2up">p. 48-49,
      Shloka 64-66</a>).

    Karma Coordinates is a fun way to assess your current position in the karmic journey across many
    lives — from the beginning to <em>Moksha</em> — by approximating your current state of Buddhi (Sandeep Dixit, 2024. <a

      Karma Coordinates</em></a>). Even a small lifestyle change can put you on the fast track,
    accelerating your journey by thousands of years!
