*Sankhya*, a doctrine by Kapil *Muni* (Sage) dating back to 5561 BCE, theorizes that the purpose of *Prakriti* (the universe) is to provide experiences to every *Jiv* (a life-form taken by *Sukshm* - a microsopic particle). Every experience results in a modification to *Buddhi* (intellect). A modification (what we call a memory) can be of *Viparyay* (Ignorance), *Ashakti* (Incapacity), *Tushti* (Complacency) or *Siddhi* (Real and true knowledge) type. With the achieving of *Siddhi*-only state the purpose of *Prakriti* is fulfilled - resulting in *Moksh* (end of *Sukshm's* journey of many lives/experiences) (Aniruddha. et al., 1915, p. 48-49, Shloka 64-66).
 
 Karma Coordinates is a fun app developed to calculate your current position in this karmic journey of many lives - from the beginning to *Moksh* - by approximating your current state of *Buddhi* (Sandeep Dixit, 2024. *Calculating Karma Coordinates*). It is important to know that even a small lifestyle change can put you on a fast-track - speeding your journey by thousands of years!
