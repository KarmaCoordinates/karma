    Karma Coordinates is an app for enhancing <strong>clarity of thinking</strong> through AI-based reflective journaling,
    assessment, and recommended activities. The Karma Coordinates—the "Lives to Moksha" metric—serves as an
    index to track progress toward greater clarity of thought. By focusing on clarity and using Karma Coordinates as a
    guide, individuals can improve decision-making, foster personal growth, and achieve success in life!

<h3>How does it work?</h3>
  <p> Karma Coordinates interprets your journal entries, uses that interpretation to answer relevant questions from the
    Clarity of Thinking assessment questionnaire, and calculates your score. Initially, your score is based on minimal
    completion of the questionnaire. As you continue to make new journal entries, the completion percentage goes up.

  <h3>How is the assessment questionnaire prepared?</h3>

    The assessment questionnaire is based on <em>Sankhya</em> — a doctrine by Sage Kapil <em>Muni</em>, dating back to 5561 BCE—which
    articulates that the purpose of the universe is to provide experiences to every life-form. Each experience results
    in a physical modification of the brain or intellect (<em>Buddhi</em>), commonly referred to as memory. These modifications
    are classified into four categories: Ignorance (<em>Viparyay</em>), Incapacity (<em>Ashakti</em>), Complacency (<em>Tushti</em>), or True Knowledge (<em>Siddhi</em>). 
    Sankhya further defines 5, 28, 9, and 8 subcategories for these categories respectively. The clarity of thinking questionnaire 
    contains 50 questions to determine the current state of these 50 subcategories. In addition Lifestyle is added as a bonus category 
    to take into account the modern ways of life. 
    Attaining the state of <em>Siddhi</em> allows one to experience the ultimate truth. At that point, the purpose of the
    universe is fulfilled—resulting in <em>Moksha</em>, the end of the life-form’s journey through many lives and experiences
    (Aniruddha et al., 1915 <a href="https://archive.org/details/thesamkhyaphilos00sinhuoft/page/48/mode/2up">p. 48-49,
      Shloka 64-66</a>).

    Karma Coordinates is a fun way to assess your current position in the karmic journey across many
    lives — from the beginning to <em>Moksha</em> — by approximating your current state of Buddhi (Sandeep Dixit, 2024. <a

    accelerating your journey by thousands of years!
