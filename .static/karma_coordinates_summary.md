<em>Sankhya</em>, a doctrine by Kapil <em>Muni</em> (Sage) dating back to 5561 BCE, articulates that the purpose of <em>Prakriti</em> (the universe) is to provide experiences to every <em>Jiv</em> (a life-form taken by <em>Sukshm</em> - a microsopic particle). Every experience results in a modification of <em>Buddhi</em> (intellect). A modification (what we call a memory) can be of <em>Viparyay</em> (Ignorance), <em>Ashakti</em> (Incapacity), <em>Tushti</em> (Complacency) or <em>Siddhi</em> (Real and true knowledge) type. With the achieving of pure <em>Siddhi</em> state the purpose of <em>Prakriti</em> is fulfilled - resulting in <em>Moksh</em> (end of <em>Sukshm's</em> journey of many lives/experiences) (Aniruddha. et al., 1915, p. 48-49, Shloka 64-66).
