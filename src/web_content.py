According to *Sankhya*-yoga, a doctrine of Kapil *Muni* (Sage) dating back to 5025 BC (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samkhya), *Prakriti* (the universe) exists for providing experiences to *Purush* (an experiencer). *Purush* upon realization that “I exist” achieves *Moksha* (liberation). *Prakriti* is constructed of three *Gunas* (root physical properties) - *Satva* (light), *Rajas* (energy) and *Tamas* (mass)  and *Purush* is an unobservable entity outside of *Prakriti* that is not constructed of these three *Gunas*.

Every *Jiva* (life-form) in *Prakriti* is engaged in providing experiences to a *Purush* that trigger *Bhava*. A life-form comes into an existence due to *Sukshm* (a microscopic particle in the nature). It is *Sukshm* that gets tinged with *Bhava* (acquired tendencies), from a life-form to life-form! Once all *Bhava* are overcome/consumed, *Purush* realizes that "I exist" and *Moksha* is achieved.

Once  all *Purush* are awakened, *Prakriti*’s work is complete and it collapses into a singularity and the next cycle big-bang - big-crunch cycle is started. As per the open model with omega of 6, universe is 6 billion years old and it will end when it is about 13 billion years old - that is in another 7 billion years (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_fate_of_the_universe). A human life is the only known form of *Sukshm* that is capable of achieving *Moksha* for its *Purush*. 

*Sankhya*-yoga quantifies *Bhava* (tendencies), overcoming which takes a *Sukshm* closer to achieving *Moksha*. Karma Coordinates is a fun app developed to calculate your current position in this karmic journey of many lives - from the beginning to *Moksha*, by approximating your current *Bhava*. 

Very important to know that one can exponentially speed-up karmic journey by certain lifestyle changes. *Moksha* is achieved during ***one*** final life-form!

Karma Coordinates outcome is also explained in terms of three *Gunas*:  
    - ***Satva*** is the *Prakash* (light) property in the *Prakriti*. The neural network in our brain - our intellect - has the highest *Satva*.  
    - ***Rajas*** is the energy property in the *Prakriti*. It moves mass. It activates. Our mind and bodies are enabled by *Rajas*.  
    - ***Tamas*** is the mass property in the *Prakriti*
